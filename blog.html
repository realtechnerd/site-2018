    <h2>Samsung Chromebook 3</h2>
    <h4>Monday, May 7, 2018 | 7:02 AM | Tech Reviews | ☆☆☆</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">Hello! Today, I'm going
    to review the Samsung Chromebook 3. The Samsung Chromebook 3, is a Chromebook
    by Samsung and Google. I'm amazed with the sleekness of this Chromebook. The
    Samsung Chromebook 3, was launched on Feburary 2017. The Chromebook has a 
    Intel HD Graphics 400, and it has a built-in 720p camera. The Chromebook
    also has Bluetooth 4.0, 802.11b/g/n/ac. It has a micro-SD slot and a HDMI slot
    as well. This has 2 USB ports, and one headphone/speaker jack. You can choose
    to pick RAM as well, and I actually picked 4 GB of RAM. It also has a TPM (Trusted Platform Module), 
    a small chip inside of your computer, made by Intel, for cyber-security. You get a 1-year limited
    warranty with the device. The CPU or Processor is a Intel Celeron N3060 / 1.6 GHz. The laptop comes
    with 32 GB of SSD - (eMMC). This laptop overall, is okay. I actually use this laptop
    for everyday use, and I think it's okay. It does lag sometimes, when you are running
    a lot of tabs on Chrome. It's okay though. I wouldn't really recommend this laptop, but
    you should atleast try it. Even though I am a Samsung Fan, I will rate this about 3 stars.
    <br/>
    You can buy the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/un

    <h2>Code Pad IDE</h2>
    <h4>Sunday, May 6, 2018 | 8:18 PM | Tech Reviews | ☆☆☆☆☆</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">Hello! Today, I wanted
    to show this IDE called Code Pad IDE. I used this code editor to make my website.
    Code Pad IDE, is a IDE (Intergrated Development Environment), that was made by
    <a href="https://github.com/andrewbrg" target="_blank">Andrew Borg</a>, a developer from Malta.
    This was initially released on December, 27, 2018. Code Pad IDE can support more than 50 programming languages, including Python and C++.
    Code Pad IDE is really good in working with HTML5. I found the design and simplicity of this website, immaculate. This IDE is kind
    of like Virtual Studio, looking at more of the design perspective. This IDE is compatible, with pretty much any Operating System
    that supports the Chrome Browser. When I think about it, I think this is actually one of the best IDEs out there,
    way ahead of Notepad++ and Eclipse. I would definitely rate this 5 stars because of its simplicity. 
    <br/>
    You can install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-pad-ide/adaepfiocmagdimjecpifghcgfjlfmkh?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">Code Pad IDE</a>
    from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a>.</p>

    <h4>Thursday, May 3, 2018 | 7:41 AM | Website Updates</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">Hello! I have been working working
